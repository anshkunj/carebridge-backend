## Inspiration
The idea behind CareBridge AI came from the need for accessible, affordable, and intelligent healthcare guidance, especially for people who cannot immediately access doctors. We also wanted to combine sustainability awareness with healthcare technology.
## What it does
CareBridge AI analyzes user symptoms using AI logic, generates health risk reports, provides medical insights, helps locate nearby hospitals, and also tracks sustainability impact like CO₂ and paper savings from digital healthcare.
## How we built it
We built CareBridge AI using a Flask backend, HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, and ReportLab for PDF medical report generation. The system integrates AI-based risk scoring, accessibility features like voice input and theme toggles, and sustainability analytics.
## Challenges we ran into
Building CareBridge AI involved several challenges, including designing accurate health risk logic without real medical datasets, ensuring seamless frontend-backend integration, and optimizing PDF report generation for performance. Implementing accessibility features while maintaining UI simplicity and deploying the system on cloud platforms with reliable API communication were also significant technical challenges. Additionally, balancing healthcare insights with sustainability analytics required careful system design.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
CareBridge AI is an accessibility-first healthcare intelligence platform that analyzes health risks using AI, generates medical reports, and promotes sustainability awareness. It helps users understand symptoms, receive risk insights, find nearby hospitals, and track environmental impact of healthcare decisions. 🚑🌱
## What we learned
We learned full-stack integration, AI logic design, accessibility-first UI development, backend deployment on cloud platforms, and building scalable APIs for real-time analysis.
